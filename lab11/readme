In this lab, you are required to write your own version of a class template that will create a dynamic stack of any data type.
Then design an inventory class that stores the following members:

serialNum:          An integer that holds a part’s serial number.
manufactDate:    a member that holds the date the part was manufactured. (can use string      
                             as data type)
lotNum:              An integer that holds the part’s lot number.


The class should have appropriate member functions for storing data into, and retrieving data from, these members. Use the stack class you defined above to hold objects of the Inventory class. Last, design a program that uses the stack class described above. The program should have a loop that asks the user if he or she wishes to add a part to inventory, or take a part from inventory. The loop should repeat until the user is finished (you might consider to display a Menu and ask the user to make a choice).
If the user wishes to add a part to inventory, the program should ask for the serial number, date of manufacture, and lot number. The data should be stored in an inventory object, and pushed onto the stack.
If the user wishes to take a part from inventory, the program should pop the top-most part from the stack and display the contents of its member variables.
When the user finishes the program, it should display the contents of the member values of all the objects that remain on the stack.
