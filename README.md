# C-plus-Datastructure
#### Problem: 
#### The program named as airport.cpp that uses a structure to store the following information for a particular month at the local airport:  
####  •	Total number of planes that landed 
####  •	Total number of planes that departed 
####  •	Greatest number of planes that landed in a given  day  that month 
####  •	Least number of planes that landed in a given  day  that month  
#### The program have an array of twelve structures to hold travel information for the entire year.  The program prompt the user to enter data for each month. Once all data is entered, the program calculate and output  the average  monthly  number of landing planes, the average monthly  number of departing planes, the total number of landing and departing planes for the year,  and the greatest and  least  number of planes that landed on any  one  day  (and  which month  it occurred in).
